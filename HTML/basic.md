# Review
* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure
  and content of a webpage.
* Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other
  HTML tags between them.
* HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is
  the child of the enclosing parent element.
* Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body>
  tags.
* Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to provide titles for
  sections of content.
* <p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
* The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
* Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
* Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
* Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing
  source.


# Self closing tag
