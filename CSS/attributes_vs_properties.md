# Css attribute
```css
selector[attribute="value"] {
 /* styles */
}
```

# Css property
```css
selector {
 property: value;
}
```

An attribute provides information about the HTML element, while a
property controls the appearance of the element. 

In CSS, properties and
attributes are two different things: Properties refer to the values that are
used to define the visual style of an HTML element, such as its color,
font-size, width, height, and so on. Attributes, on the other hand, are used to
provide additional information about an HTML element, such as its ID, class, or
data-* attributes.
