* The :nth-child() CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on the indexes of
  the elements in the child list of their parents. In other words, the
  :nth-child() selector selects child elements according to their position
  among all the sibling elements within a parent element.

* The :nth-of-type() CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position
  among siblings of the same type (tag name).
