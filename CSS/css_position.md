[CSS Layout - The position Property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)

There are five different position values:
* static (default)
* relative
* fixed
* absolute
* sticky

**Most usfult values**
* relative 
* absolute
* fixed


## Static
* HTML elements are positioned static by default.
* Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
* An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:

## Relative 
* An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
* Use top, bottom, left or right to move the element relative to where it would normally occur in the document.

## Fixed
* An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
  which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
  The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

## Absolute
* An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest
positioned **parent** element (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like
fixed).


## Sticky
* See example
