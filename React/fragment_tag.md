# React Fragment Tag
```javascript
<React.Fragment>
   Hello world
</React.Fragment>
```

The fragments eliminate the wrapper div which can cause problems with invalid
HTML and with styling of the components plus the fact that they are faster and
the DOM is less cluttered.

## Short syntax
```javascript
<>
   Hello world
</>
```
