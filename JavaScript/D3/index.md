# D3
Despite many visualization packages being available in Python, it is not always
straightforward to make beautiful stand-alone and interactive charts that can
also work outside your own machine. The key advantage of D3 is that it works
with web standards so you don’t need any other technology than a browser to
make use of D3.

D3 is one of the most popular JS libraries not just for data visualization, but
also animations, data analysis, geo, and data utilities. It uses HTML, SVG, and
CSS. It has a gigantic API and some say it’s not a data visualization library
at all.
