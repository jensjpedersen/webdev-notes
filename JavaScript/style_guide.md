# Space around operators
`let x = y + z;` 


# Statment rules

## Simple vs complex statements
Simple statment: `a = 3;`  
Complex statment: A complex statement is a sequence of ('simple') statements inside {}.

## Always end a simple statement with a semicolon.
`const cars = ["Volvo", "Saab", "Fiat"];` 


This is a simple statment: 
```css
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
```

## Complex statments
* Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
* Use one space before the opening bracket.
* Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
* Do not end a complex statement with a semicolon.


* Simple stament inside -> complex statment: 
```javascript
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
```


# Naming conventions
* Camel case is most used. 
* Undersore is allowed if prefered.
